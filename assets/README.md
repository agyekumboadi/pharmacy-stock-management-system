# Assets (Screenshots & Evidence Pack)

This folder contains **screenshots that document the full PHAnford Aronium POS setup** — from checkout, to stock valuation, to reporting, to security controls, to backups, to promotions.

These visuals are intentionally organised to read like a walkthrough:
**“How the pharmacy runs” → “How stock is managed” → “How we report” → “How we secure it” → “How we protect the database” → “How we promote health products responsibly.”**
